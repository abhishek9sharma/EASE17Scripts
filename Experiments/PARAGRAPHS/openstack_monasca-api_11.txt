StackForge Java Build
 There is a pom.xml in the base directory that should only be used for the StackForge build. The StackForge build is a rather strange build because of the limitations of the current StackForge java jobs and infrastructure. We have found that the API runs faster if built with maven 3 but the StackForge nodes only have maven 2. This build checks the version of maven and if not maven 3, it downloads a version of maven 3 and uses it. This build depends on jars that are from monasca-common. That StrackForge build uploads the completed jars to http://tarballs.openstack.org/ci/monasca-common, but they are just regular jars, and not in a maven repository and sometimes zuul takes a long time to do the upload. Hence, the first thing the maven build from the base project does is invoke build_common.sh in the common directory. This script clones monasca-common and then invokes maven 3 to build monasca-common in the common directory and install the jars in the local maven repository. Since this is all rather complex, that part of the build only works on StackForge so follow the simple instruction above if you are building your own monasca-api. Currently this build is executed on the bare-precise nodes in StackForge and they only have maven 2. So, this build must be kept compatible with Maven 2. If another monasca-common jar is added as a dependency to /java/pom.xml, it must also be added to download/download.sh. Combining monasca-common, monasca-thresh, monasca-api and monasca-persister into one build would vastly simplify the builds but that is a future task.`
