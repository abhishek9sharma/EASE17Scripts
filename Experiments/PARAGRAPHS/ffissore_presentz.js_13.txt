Dependencies quick reference
 (skip if you are still not using presentz.js but just reading this README) Depending on which video and slide sources you are using, you need zero to a couple of additional js libraries JQuery
SWFObject: if your slides are made with flash or if they are hosted on slideshare
Froogaloop: if your video is on Vimeo
Mediaelementjs: if you host your video files on your own. There are also .css files and images to setup a good looking player, so using medialementjs requires some additional effort. Since the following APIs cannot be bundled*, Presentz.js will load them on its own Youtube IFrame API (*) It's either technically or legally impossible or unconvenient
