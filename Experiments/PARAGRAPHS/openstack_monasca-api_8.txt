Keystone Roles
 The Monasca API has two levels of access: Full access - user can read/write metrics and Alarm Definitions and Alarms
Agent access - user can only write metrics The reason for the "Agent access" level is because the Monasca Agent must be configured to use a Keystone user. Since the user and password are configured on all of the systems running the Monasca Agent, this user is most in danger of being compromised. If this user is limited to only writing metrics, then the damage can be limited. To configure the user to have full access, the user must have a role that is listed in defaultAuthorizedRoles. To configure a user to have only "Agent access", the user must have a role in agentAuthorizedRoles and none of the roles in defaultAuthorizedRoles. If you want to give users the ability to only view data, configure one or more roles in the readOnlyAuthorizedRoles list.
