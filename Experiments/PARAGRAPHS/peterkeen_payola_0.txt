Installation
 Add Payola to your Gemfile: gem 'payola-payments' Run the installer: $ rails g payola:install
$ rake db:migrate (Note: do not run . Payola's migrations live inside the gem and do not get copied into your application.) Optionally, tell Stripe about your application. Add this as a webhook in your Stripe dashboard: https://your.website.example.com/payola/events
